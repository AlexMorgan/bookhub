Bookhub is a Ruby on Rails web application that allows users to buy, sell and trade university textbooks with a 3 step process. Using Amazon's Affiliates API students are able to simply supply a simple book title, quality of the book and a price and bookhub will take care of the rest of the information from there. Users can then view all of their activity on a fully-responsive dashboard, where they can handle transactions and create a wishlist as well.
